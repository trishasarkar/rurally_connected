# Rurally connected
* A web application which aims to motivate the rural youth to pursue agriculture or handicrafts, bring their products to a global audience and provide employment qualified individuals
* This website is a partial prototype which we pitched at the Chhatra Vishwakarma Awards 2021 by AICTE India, where we were State Level Qualifiers
* This user interface is for a schematic representation only 

## Demystification

* Along with providing a basic idea of the proposed solution, we pitched various other business aspects like - financials, outreach plans and our estimated impact
* The actual deck presented in the competition can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ipYK4ZCYpOCO0EcYos8UQi83y7GeuhJZWFNQeiA0pNo/edit?usp=sharing)
